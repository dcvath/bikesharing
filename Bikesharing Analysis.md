## Summary
Overall, there is a strong case for bikesharing businesses, particularly among the male demographic. Further analysis should be conducted to determine the market within Des Moines. The two additioinal analysis I would recommend would be to determine the number of young people and males within the Des Moiines metro area. If there are a high number of males and younger people, it's likley that the bikesharing business will florish in Des Moines. I would attempt to obtain this data from the Census bureau.
